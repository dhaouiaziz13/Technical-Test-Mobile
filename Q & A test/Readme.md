# Futter is a cross-platform development framework that allows developers to create apps across iOS,

# Android, web, and MacOS by writing code only once. The beauty of Flutter is that it renders a native

# look and feel in each app by drawing the UI from scratch, rather than acting as a wrapper.

# This open-source framework developed by Google can be a lifesaver for

# companies who want to develop multi-platform apps on a limited budget or time that are also easy to maintain .

# This Flutter test evaluates candidates’ skills and knowledge in developing apps using the Flutter framework.

# This test will help you hire developers who are skilled in Flutter and

# can create and improve code to get the desired outcomes.
